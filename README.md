# Codeshop

Codeshop is a video-game platform where you can buy licenses to video games which can then be used perpetually.
The main features of code-shop are as follows:

## Public/Private cryptographic keys

The authentication system is secure since you can only sign in using a pubic cryptographic key known only to you. Furthermore, the combination of public and private keys is required to authorize transactions on your behalf.

## Crypto tokens

The marketplace used crypto tokens issed by the marketplace in order to conduct transactions

## Complete Transaction Record

Each and every transaction between the user and the marketplace is recorded and available for the user to verify at any time.

## Immutability

Assuming the future addition of a smart-contract in the application's logic, the data is organized in a way that ensures immutability. Once the logic is implemented in a smart contract, there can be no changes in the user's previous records.

## Support for mined currency

Each transaction is organized in a manner appropriate to represent a mining block. Given additional development time , it is possible to convert the mining process from a centralized structure to a decentralized system.
The shop can also be integrated with bitcoin systems to allow gamers to use their mined currency for buying games.
